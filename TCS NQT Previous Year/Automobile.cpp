/*
Problem Statement â€“ An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
 

The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

 

Example :

Input :

200  -> Value of V
540   -> Value of W
Output :

TW =130 FW=70
 

Explanation:

130+70 = 200 vehicles

(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels
